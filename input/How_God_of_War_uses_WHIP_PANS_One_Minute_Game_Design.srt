1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
This trick is just something I thought you might find cool.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,040
How do you transition the player from anywhere in the room to where you want them?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,599
Cinematography is ever more relevant in games.

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,040
Walk through a door, cutscene.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,919
Fight someone?

6
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:12,560
Cutscene.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,120
We don't want our transitions to cutscenes to be jarring.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,199
The God of War developers wanted the entire game to be in one single shot.

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,400
Which is absolutely crazy to even conceive.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,440
But there are still some people who believe in witchcraft it would seem.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,560
In this scene, Kratos can finish this fight anywhere in this space,

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,160
but then needs to be over here.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
How would you do this and still keep it in one shot?

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,159
This is a whip pan transition.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,439
You would have seen them in the travel vlogs where you all vicariously live through.

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,799
Sad wallet.

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,799
They get used in big productions too.

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,799
Rotate out to create motion blur?

19
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,879
Rotate in creating motion blur?

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,399
Hide the cut somewhere in the middle.

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,519
Taking inspiration from this, here's how God of War does it.

22
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:53,120
The camera gets way in close to make us focus on the characters.

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,079
Spin the characters to blur everything in the background.

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,519
Hide the unnatural teleport or slide in the motion blur.

25
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,439
It's actually really effective.

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,439
You probably didn't notice it until I told you.

27
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,840
It's important that the player is focusing on the foreground and not the background though.

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,920
Otherwise they will notice what we are doing.

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,920
This is why the foregrounds of these scenes have such pronounced movements.

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,879
There's a bunch more one minute tips like this one in this playlist.

31
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,719
Maybe take five minutes to check a few out.
